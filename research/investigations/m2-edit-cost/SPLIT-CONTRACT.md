# Split fragment dependency experiment (Q134; Q135 A)

## Question and prior rejection criterion

From cf12c609e1c00f86bb431fab4e92f5dca2bf94f2, compare stable anchored
run records (A) with flat rectangles reached through a dependency index (B).
The owner authorized both experiments, not adoption of either. Reject a
performance acceptance claim unless both sentence and font-size edits are
within twice concurrent main in each mode and both hosted rounds. Measure
all six X5 kinds on ecma262 and html5, with the merged base and its independent
same-source twin, using identical scripts, compiler, host and settings.
Correctness remains byte-identical full dumps, incremental/full identity in
both modes, unchanged cases, every page block edit splice 1 reason 0, and all
existing falsifiers plus one omission of each option's targeted repair.

This document owns the experiment's contract and results. It lives beside
[the cost investigation](DESIGN.md); fold its surviving conclusions into that
record when the experiment branches are retired. No experiment is merged into
research/m2-layout and no pull request is opened.

## Contract before implementation

The reference is the existing full fragment generator, checked against the
project's external rendering oracles; cached output is never a correctness
oracle. The relevant owners are `design/pipeline.md`,
`design/pipeline/layout.md`, and the stable-split section of
`../structure-edits/layout-design.md`. The merged anchors already identify
endpoints. Q134 therefore concerns retaining run correspondence and complete
invalidation, rather than inventing an endpoint identity absent from the base.

A split is one open inline owner interrupted by an Open(block) or
Child(context) payload. A run is a maximal sequence of that owner's splits
whose intervening flow events are all lineless paragraphs. Multiple runs of
one owner remain distinct even when their rectangles coincide. Fragment
identity is run identity plus role (leading, spanning, trailing), never owner
plus rectangle. Paragraph text/inline fragments retain paragraph ownership.
Context-owned empty-inline fragments retain their source paragraph's reference
scratch semantics: a lineless paragraph does not acquire a translated origin.

| Output | Inputs, including negative dependencies |
|---|---|
| Run membership/order | Split source order and owner; first/last live payload identities; every intervening event's kind and paragraph line-presence bit. An absent separating line is an input. |
| Leading fragment existence | The event immediately preceding the first opening; whether it is lined; its closing inline-owner marks. |
| Leading y selector | `sibling_above` backwards through lineless paragraphs, floats and positioned events to the first discriminating event; whether a closed block is itself a split head; Split.line sentinel. |
| Leading y | First visual top, or pending line position from the first normal origin and exact offset; preserve the selector and saturation order. |
| Spanning rectangle | First split's containing left/width; context content left; first visual top; last visual top and height. Height is `(last_top +sat last_height) -sat first_top`. |
| Trailing existence | Event immediately after the last close; its line presence and opening inline-owner marks. |
| Trailing y | Last visual top, height, and resolved bottom margin, whose percentage basis is the first split width. |
| Empty-inline rectangle | Source paragraph's marks and styles, absence of that owner from the split-owner set, paragraph left and its retained lineless resolved position. |

Text can change shaping, line count, height, intrinsic contributions and
line-presence, hence run joining and adjacent-fragment existence. Unchanged
line presence is insufficient when owner marks change. Font-size can also
change inherited lengths, widths, margins, pending lines, and the containing
block's geometry. Class changes use actual style deltas: paint-only changes
leave these inputs unchanged; layout or generated-content changes follow all
style uses, including visibility of an inline's own fragment. Block insertion
or removal changes order, source ownership, adjacency and lifetimes. A kept
split head's interior edit changes its extent without necessarily changing
its external run. The existing structural certificate proves which complete
block seams preserve run topology and selectors; it must not be weakened.

Recompute topology when any membership, adjacency, source or selector input
changes. Recompute geometry only for changed geometric inputs. A uniform
translation with unchanged local geometry and exact arithmetic changes no
run topology or dimensions; A changes the owning origin, whereas B writes
each affected flat rectangle. A spanning run whose endpoints move differently
recomputes its extent. A changed pending margin repairs Split.line's offset;
translation alone preserves it only under the same exact-arithmetic and
sentinel conditions as the existing motion certificate. A changed width or
margin always refreshes the corresponding run fields, even if height agrees.

Validity has separate topology, geometry and scratch obligations. An anchor
certificate is carried only across edits whose dependency closure preserves
it; changed expressions must be checked against freshly computed reference
rectangles. Raw scratch is authoritative after reference replay until repaired
anchors are certified. A stale raw rectangle cannot be compared as if it were
fresh, nor can a fresh anchor override a legitimate reference result. The full
bridge remains necessary when a legacy reader requires all resolved scratch.
Missing metadata, retired endpoints or failed numeric conditions retain the
existing reference behavior; no new source limitation is introduced.

## Candidate data, invariants and true order

A retains a context-lifetime run slot, its first/last split endpoints, explicit
fragment roles, horizontal inputs, trailing margin, leading selector and
owner-relative line offset. A reverse dependency index maps changed sources
and adjacency intervals to runs. Distinct runs never alias through coordinates.
Run slots remain stable while topology survives; replacement retires old
slots, and stale references must never name new runs. No global identity
counter is needed: context identity plus local non-reused slot suffices.
Context replacement retires its entire identity domain. Exhaustion is checked
before publication; a saturated counter is not a valid fresh identity.

B retains the same semantic dependencies and lifetime distinction, but its
published outputs are flat rectangles. An index maps source identities and
flow intervals to disjoint rectangle slots. Source or topology replacement
updates that mapping before reuse. Geometry repair writes the actual affected
rectangles, including every translated suffix rectangle. Coincident rectangles
are separate destinations. Lookup cannot use rectangle intersection, because
negative margins and coincident geometry are valid.

Both candidates start with independent text/style preparation and speculative
paragraph breaking. Flow placement follows only margin/float/available-space
dependencies. Changed line-presence and marks select topology repair; stable
run membership permits independent endpoint, width and margin evaluation.
Each run's outputs depend on its endpoints and selectors, not on another run's
rectangle. Dependency lookup is read-only; disjoint repair destinations run
independently. Publication follows preparation of complete replacement records;
ancestor summary reduction follows the existing tree. Read-only snapshots or
function-kind parameters may expose these independent writes without shared
append cursors. A shared mutable work queue, serial run scan or global
allocation counter would add an unjustified order.

A's order ends at changed local inputs and ancestor origins; absolute
resolution belongs to dump/paint. B adds the necessary flat-output writes after
a movement is known, but those writes are mutually independent. Topology
joining has an order dependency on source adjacency, not on geometric repair
of preceding runs. Balanced summaries can discover independent runs without
serial reconstruction of the whole context. Full rebuilding of unchanged runs
is an experiment limitation, not fulfillment of bounded repair.

The i32 reference operation order is normative for both candidates. Widened
owner differences are exact i64 differences; narrowing happens at the same
observable boundary as the reference. In particular, translating a previously
clamped height is not equivalent to re-evaluating two endpoints. `no_line` and
`no_index` remain sentinels and cannot be reused as finite coordinates or live
identities. Existing saturation and structural falsifiers remain enabled.

## Status

Contract recorded before implementation. Q135 A is authorized and closed;
Q134 remains open pending both prototypes, validation and measurements.

## Whitefoot requirements

Gaps Snowghost needs Whitefoot to close, each stated as its minimal semantic
example apart from the renderer code that exposed it
([AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#the-whitefoot-boundary)).

- **A file named by bytes cannot be opened through a symbolic link.**
  `std::fs::open_directory` and `std::fs::open_file` open one component with
  `O_NOFOLLOW`, and `std::fs::open_read`, which follows links, takes a
  `RelativePath` that only `relative_path` of an argument's `HostString`
  forms. A program given a directory `d` that must open `d/n.png` for names
  `n` read from a file therefore fails when a component of `d` is a link:
  `open_directory(root: cwd, name: "build")` fails with host error 20
  (`ENOTDIR`) and no std call reaches the file. Impact: `png_oracle check`
  refuses its `DIR` in a worktree whose `build` is a link to another
  checkout's build directory, so `make oracle-png` fails there; a `DIR`
  spelling that reaches the same directory without a link works. Change: a
  std function that forms a `RelativePath` from a byte range, or a component
  open that follows links. Reopen when oracle runs from such worktrees are
  needed.

## Snowghost

- **No mechanical check for documents and artifacts.** `make check` does not
  refuse non-English text, personal filesystem paths or broken Markdown links
  and anchors; completion reviewers check them by hand (checklist A4 and D2).
  Whitefoot's `make static` stages `repository-invariants` and `guidance` are
  the models. Add the equivalent when the documents grow enough that a missed
  link or leaked path costs review time, or when one first reaches a pull
  request.
- **CI rebuilds the Whitefoot compiler on every push.** A `make check` run
  takes about two and a half minutes, most of it the compiler build. Cache
  the built compiler keyed by the `whitefoot/` pin when the gate's run time
  starts to slow down work, or when the pin moves often enough that the
  build dominates.
- **`bytes_push` (`html/tokenizer/buffers.wf`) leaves cell unchanged, rather
  than proving it, when a push would cross `ceiling`.** `text_ceiling` (3 *
  2^30) and `attribute_ceiling` (2^30) are sized from `next_token`'s own
  `source^.len <= 2^30` requirement and this module's worst-case per-source-byte
  expansion (a NUL becoming three-byte U+FFFD; no attribute without consuming
  a source byte), so no legitimate caller reaches ceiling and the guard is
  dead on every input the module accepts. Proving that mechanically needs a
  loop-position invariant (current output length vs. source position
  consumed) in every `scan_*` state that pushes text or attributes
  (`data_state.wf`, `text_states.wf`, `script_data.wf`, `comments.wf`,
  `doctype.wf`, `tags.wf`), tying each state's own advancement to the
  3x/1x bound above; `bytes_push` and its `push_byte`/`push_codepoint`/
  `push_attribute` callers already carry the exact `requires`/`ensures`
  pair such a proof would need (drafted and reverted; the reachable half,
  within `bytes_push` itself, checks). Add it if a stress input, fuzz run or
  future state addition raises real doubt that the sizing argument still
  holds, or when another finding forces the same loop-invariant work anyway.
